    "text": "Motivation\nThe story of Sailor Shift is more than a tale of individual stardom — it is a reflection of how local culture, through music, can resonate on a global scale. Her rise from a small island nation to the forefront of the international music scene not only brought worldwide recognition to Oceanus Folk but also reshaped the genre itself. Sailor’s rising popularity led to greater interest in the genre’s roots, its collaborators, and its influence across musical styles.\nThis project is motivated by the opportunity to explore that transformation through data. By visualising the rich network of artistic relationships, genre influences, and temporal trends captured in a comprehensive knowledge graph, we aim to illustrate the pivotal role Sailor Shift has played as a prominent ambassador of Oceanus Folk. In collaboration with journalist Silas Reed, we seek to create meaningful visualisations that reveal the deeper story behind Sailor’s success, trace the evolution of Oceanus Folk, and uncover new and compelling insights along the way.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis project aims to build interactive visualisation tools that allow journalist Silas Reed and his readers to explore and uncover meaningful insights into Sailor Shift’s career and the influence of Oceanus Folk on the global music scene. The key objectives are as follows.\n\nUnderstand the Profile of Sailor Shift’s Career\nVisualisations will trace Sailor’s artistic journey, highlighting who has influenced her over time, her key collaborators, and the individuals she has directly or indirectly influenced. It will also explore how she has impacted members of the broader Oceanus Folk community.\nExamine the Spread and Evolution of Oceanus Folk\nThe tools will map how Oceanus Folk has spread through the musical world by identifying whether its influence has been intermittent or gradual, pinpointing the most influenced genres and artists, and showing how the genre itself has evolved, especially through Sailor’s influence and cross-genre inspiration.\nDevelop a Profile of a Rising Star in the Music Industry\nBy visualising and comparing the career trajectories of three artists, the project will uncover key patterns in how an artist’s influence evolve as he/she gains popularity. These patterns will then guide data-driven predictions about the next generation of Oceanus Folk artists expected to rise in the coming five years.\n\n\n\nData\nThis project explores the dataset provided by VAST Challenge 2025 Mini-Challenge 1. It is a comprehensive knowledge graph capturing the landscape of the the music industry. The graph consist of 17,412 nodes and 37,857 edges, organised into 17 connected components.\nEach node represents a person, song, record label, album, or musical group. The edges represent the relationships between connected nodes, as defined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdge Type\nSource Node(s)\nDestination Node(s)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPerformerOf\nPerson, MusicalGroup\nSong, Album\nSource performed the destination.\n\n\nComposerOf\nPerson\nSong, Album\nSource composed the destination.\n\n\nProducerOf\nPerson, RecordLabel\nSong, Album, Person, MusicalGroup\nSource participated in the production of the destination’s work.\n\n\nLyricistOf\nPerson\nSong, Album\nSource wrote lyrics for the destination.\n\n\nRecordedBy\nSong, Album\nRecordLabel\nDestination aided in the recording process for the source.\n\n\nDistributedBy\nSong, Album\nRecordLabel\nDestination aided in the distribution process for the source.\n\n\nInStyleOf\nSong, Album\nSong, Album, Person, MusicalGroup\nSource was performed at least partly in the style of the destination.\n\n\nInterpolatesFrom\nSong, Album\nSong, Album\nSource interpolated a melody from the destination.\n\n\nCoverOf\nSong, Album\nSong, Album\nSource is a cover of the destination.\n\n\nLyricalReferenceTo\nSong, Album\nSong, Album\nSource makes a lyrical reference to the destination.\n\n\nDirectlySamples\nSong, Album\nSong, Album\nSource directly reuses a portion of the destination’s audio via sampling.\n\n\nMemberOf\nPerson\nMusicalGroup\nSource is (or was) a member of the destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\nDownload the library for DiagrammeR before loading the packages.\n\nDiagramExplanation\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngrViz(\"\ndigraph flowchart {\n  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB, fontname = 'Helvetica', fontsize = 12]\n  \n  # Global node settings\n  node [shape = box, style = filled, fontname = 'Helvetica']\n  \n  # Input nodes\n  input [label = 'MC1_graph.json', fillcolor = '#FFE4B5', color = '#FFA500', penwidth = 1.5]\n  read [label = 'Read input', fillcolor = '#E6E6FA', color = '#9370DB']\n  clean [label = 'Data Pre-processing', fillcolor = '#E6E6FA', color = '#9370DB']\n  \n  # Visualization nodes\n  plot_net [label = 'Plot network graphs', fillcolor = '#ADD8E6', color = '#4682B4']\n  plot_bar [label = 'Plot barchart', fillcolor = '#98FB98', color = '#2E8B57']\n  plot_line [label = 'Plot line chart', fillcolor = '#98FB98', color = '#2E8B57']\n  \n  # Analysis nodes\n  bayesian [label = 'Bayesian Surprise', fillcolor = '#FFDAB9', color = '#CD853F']\n  entropy [label = 'Genre Entropy', fillcolor = '#FFDAB9', color = '#CD853F']\n  \n  # Output node\n  shiny [label = 'Shiny App', fillcolor = '#FFB6C1', color = '#FF69B4', shape = ellipse, style = 'filled,rounded']\n  \n  # Edges\n  input -&gt; read -&gt; clean\n  clean -&gt; plot_net [color = '#4682B4']\n  clean -&gt; plot_bar [color = '#2E8B57']\n  clean -&gt; plot_line [color = '#2E8B57']\n  clean -&gt; bayesian [color = '#CD853F']\n  clean -&gt; entropy [color = '#CD853F']\n  bayesian -&gt; plot_line [color = '#CD853F']\n  entropy -&gt; plot_line [color = '#CD853F']\n  plot_net -&gt; shiny [color = '#4682B4']\n  plot_bar -&gt; shiny [color = '#2E8B57']\n  plot_line -&gt; shiny [color = '#2E8B57']\n  \n  # Main subgraph for Data Exploration and Visualisation\n  subgraph cluster_explore {\n    label = &lt;Data Exploration and Visualisation&gt;\n    labelloc = t\n    labeljust = c\n    style = filled\n    fillcolor = '#F5F5F5'\n    color = '#696969'\n    margin = 20\n    fontname = 'Helvetica-Bold'\n    fontsize = 14\n    \n    # Statisical Analysis\n    subgraph cluster_statistics {\n      label = &lt;Statistical Analysis&gt;\n      labelloc = t\n      labeljust = c\n      style = filled\n      fillcolor = '#FFF8DC'\n      color = '#DAA520'\n      margin = 15\n      fontsize = 12\n      bayesian\n      entropy\n    }\n    \n    # Temporal Analysis subgroup\n    subgraph cluster_temporal {\n      label = &lt;Temporal Analysis&gt;\n      labelloc = t\n      labeljust = c\n      style = filled\n      fillcolor = '#F0FFF0'\n      color = '#228B22'\n      margin = 15\n      fontsize = 12\n      plot_bar\n      plot_line\n    }\n    \n    # Influence Analysis subgroup\n    subgraph cluster_influence {\n      label = &lt;Influence Analysis&gt;\n      labelloc = t\n      labeljust = c\n      style = filled\n      fillcolor = '#F0F8FF'\n      color = '#4169E1'\n      margin = 15\n      fontsize = 12\n      plot_net\n    }\n    \n    shiny\n  }\n}\n\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Pre-processing: Ensure data integrity prior to analysis.\n\nValidation of Node and Edge integrity: Check and remove any missing or duplicate nodes and edges to ensure a consistent and accurate representation of the network.\nSchema compliance: Verify all edges against the predefined schema to confirm that source and destination node types were correctly aligned with their corresponding edge types.
